This is the code repository for paper "Who Stole My Attention: A Transferability Insight into Model Inversion Attack on ViTs".

The two current Jupyter notebooks can serve as a visual playground for quickly testing and validating our paper's ideas. The complete code, suitable for rigorous training, will be released after anonymity is ended.

- `invViT-notebook.ipynb`: **Experiment 1** in our paper, which trains a powerful inversion model against ViT.
- `finetune-notebook`: **Experiment 3** in our paper, which reveals the power of VIB in defensing transferable MIA attacks.
